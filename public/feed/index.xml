<p>As a freelance developer, I'm thrilled to share about <a href="https://neuraleffects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neural Effects</a>, a project I've had the privilege to work on. This website is a comprehensive platform that provides a wealth of information and resources for concussion and mild brain injury treatment.</p>
<p>My favorite part of the site is the animation in the top header that moves with the cursor! I used tilt.js to animate an SVG graphic with different layers and perspective. It was a lot of fun to build and the client loved it!</p>

<a title="Vita Brevis Films" href="https://vitabrevisfilms.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vita Brevis Films</a> hired me to build the second version of their main website. This was a huge overhaul in terms of function and style compared to their last website. You can view the <a title="Old VBF Site Writeup" href="/vbf-legacy-site-2013-2018/">writeup for the previous site here.</a>

The goal was to deliver a minimal portfolio showcase. The previous site had excelled in written content and typography, this version was to simply deliver their portfolio more visually. The nav menu was also simplified
down to "Info" and a search box behind a magnifying icon.

		<p>The pace and scale of a Presidential campaign made working on this site rather unique. Great care had to be taken to keep the code base organized and documented. Late night edits became the norm. Watching Kasich in the Republican debates was a rush. Keeping an eye analytics and server load in tandem with Kasich's screen time was a stressful yet exhilirating experience.</p>
		<p>Although Kasich dropped out in May 2016, I'm nonetheless proud of the site and the many lessons I learned about running a website on this scale.</p>

		<p>Branding for yourself is always a good reality check. Before we even picked a name, we had to look at the work objectively. What is the message? What flavor of music do we make? It's fun. Bold. Playful. Party funk perhaps? The name "Rumble Gums" packs a punch, while keeping it playful.</p>
		<p>As our first album neared completion, we strategized. Creating a logo, grinding on social media, launching a website, and releasing of our first single, <em>Smooth Talkin'</em>.</p>

		<p>Here's a time-lapse where you can see the assembly of the set. The whole process (including editing and photography) took about six hours. It was really rewarding getting everyone together to participate and have a say in the final product. We couldn't be happier with the result.</p>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>As Head of Development for <a href="http://online.arenacomm.com/" title="Arena Online" target="blank">Arena Online</a>, I took the rebuilding of their main site very seriously. The management was confident in giving me complete creative control over both design and development. We got to work, starting with several meetings discussing goals of the site and how to acheive them.</p>
		<p>First on the list, we needed fresh photography representing the people and culture of Arena. I followed the hired photographer around, cueing him on the framing I needed to lay things out on the new site. Individual employee shots were also taken, as well as an outdoor company-wide photo shoot out on the Salt Flats outside of Salt Lake City.</p>
		<p>As for designing the site, I used Photoshop to lay everything out and get feedback before I got to coding. I wanted simple, bold sections describing what we do and who we are. The slideshow up top features pictures of employees smiling, helping clients, and working hard. The text in the slides illustrate our focus on clients and innovation.</p>

		<p>My role in building out a site for <a href="http://utahmediahouse.com/" target="blank" title="Utah Media House">Utah Media House</a> was simple and exciting. I started by working with their design team helping them make informed desicions for layout and functionality. After the site was designed, I chopped up and coded out the Photoshop files provided to me.</p>
		<p>The main feature is the background video at the top of the home page. After converting it to browser-specific formats, I made sure it loads and fades in nicely <em>after</em> the page loads, so as not to affect the PageSpeed score. On mobile, an embedded demo reel takes it's place.</p>
		<p>As with all my sites, I try and give the client as much control over editing their content as possible. Not only does this allow them to make as many edits as they see fit, but it cuts down on post-launch development costs. I achieve this using WordPress as a CMS, and a nifty plugin called Advanced Custom Fields. The client can swap out images, text, links, and more, all on their own without ever touching code.</p>
		<p>Development and edits took under two weeks, and we were able to launch smoothly soon after that. The sites aesthetics are clean, minimal, and direct. This helps with lead generation and building lasting relationships with their customers. You can check out the site <a href="http://utahmediahouse.com/" target="blank" title="Utah Media House">here.</a></p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<a href="http://vitabrevisfilms.com/" target="blank" title="Vita Brevis Films" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vita Brevis Films</a> is a Salt Lake City based film production company shooting short videos and commercials for clients such as Red Bull and Adobe. Working closely with the marketing staff at VBF was exciting and collaboration was key as we explored various layouts, features, and functions for the site.

<h3>Home page grid</h3>
The most robust feature is the grid on the home page. Not only does it include complex overlays, I needed to set it up in a way they could manage it themselves. I employed the use of a plugin called <a href="http://www.lcweb.it/media-grid" target="_blank" title="media grid" rel="noopener noreferrer">Media Grid</a>. This allowed for a drag-n-drop interface in the back end where they could specify the size and positioning of each block in the backend of WordPress.

The overlay itself was fairly complex as well. Pulling dynamic data from the back end including post number, category, post link, excerpt, etc. The end result is a beautiful responsive display of their most recent projects.

In the process of customizing the overlay, I reached out to the plugin developer for some help. After reviewing my code and seeing the result, he noted that it was the most complex overlay he's seen implemented in his plugin.

<div class="row padder_bot">
<div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2">
<h3>Other challenges and functionality</h3>
Another feature included a <a href="http://vitabrevisfilms.com/showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showcase section</a> in which they could list videos when clicked would show up in the player at the top. Since loading 12+ embedded videos on page load is a performance nightmare, each video is loaded only after clicking play on the top poster.
<div class="padder_sm">
			<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://chasechristensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/showcase2.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="907" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388" srcset="https://chasechristensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/showcase2.jpg 970w, https://chasechristensen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/showcase2-300x281.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 970px) 100vw, 970px" /></div>
Being a photography company, image quality was very important on this site. JPG compression can be helpful for typical websites but when their clients expect crisp camera work, VBF needed to have high resolution images across the whole site. The challenge with this approach, as with most sites, is mobile performance. There's no need to load a 2,000 pixel wide photo on a phone. To address this, I created options for them to add smaller mobile versions of each featured image, to swap automatically if the user is on mobile.
<div class="padder_xs hidden-xs hidden-sm"></div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
VBF has seen enormous success with this site. Now on their 41st blog post, they have done an excellent job curating the content and maintaining readers' engagement. This project opened up the door for many more websites with them and their clients, including a site for <a href="http://www.redmanmovies.com/" title="Redman Movies" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redman Movies equiment rental website</a>.
